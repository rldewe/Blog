            <p>Hey there! I'm <b>Mer</b>, a graphic designer by day and a passionate hiking and photography enthusiast by night. When I'm not working, I find joy in exploring the great outdoors, capturing beautiful landscapes and moments through my camera lens, and diving into captivating books that transport me to different worlds. I'm also a proud pet parent to two adorable dogs, Luna and Max, who bring endless happiness to my life with their playful antics and unwavering loyalty.
